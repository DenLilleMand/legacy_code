	 * Her hører noter mhs. til interfaced 'Set' til.
	 * 
	 * The ADT 'set' is a bag that does not allow duplicate entries. Although we
	 * leave the specification and implementation of the set as exercises in
	 * this and subsequent chapters, we do want to present the standard
	 * interface Set, which belongs to the package java.util within the java
	 * Class Library. Sets that adhere to the specifications of this interface
	 * do not contain a pair of objects x and y such that x.equals(y) is true.
	 * The following method headers declared in the interface Set are similar to
	 * the methods within our BagInterface. The differences between a method in
	 * Set and a corresponding method in BagInterface are highlighted. 
	 * 
	 * 	public boolean add(T newEntry)
		public boolean remove(Object anEntry)
		public void clear()
		public boolean contains(Object anEntry)
		public boolean isEmpty()
		public int size()
		public Object[] toArray()
	 * 
	 * Each of
	 * the interfaces Set and BagInterface declare methods that are not in the
	 * other.
