	 * Binary Search Trees In Chapter 8 we introduced the tree data structure
	 * and demonstrated a variety of applications. One important use is as a
	 * search tree (as described on page 338). In this chapter, we use a
	 * search-tree structure to efficiently implement a sorted map. The three
	 * most fundamental methods of of a map (see Section 10.1.1) are: get(k):
	 * Returns the value v associated with key k, if such an entry exists;
	 * otherwise returns null. put(k, v): Associates value v with key k,
	 * replacing and returning any existing value if the map already contains an
	 * entry with key equal to k. remove(k): Removes the entry with key equal to
	 * k, if one exists, and returns its value; otherwise returns null. The
	 * sorted map ADT includes additional functionality (see Section 10.3),
	 * guaranteeing that an iteration reports keys in sorted order, and
	 * supporting additional searches such as higherEntry(k) and subMap(k1, k2).
	 * Binary trees are an excellent data structure for storing entries of a
	 * map, assuming we have an order relation defined on the keys. In this
	 * chapter, we define a binary search tree as a proper binary tree (see
	 * Section 8.2) such that each internal position p stores a key-value pair
	 * (k,v) such that: • Keys stored in the left subtree of p are less than k.
	 * • Keys stored in the right subtree of p are greater than k. An example of
	 * such a binary search tree is given in Figure 11.1. Notice that the leaves
	 * of the tree serve only as “placeholders.” Their use as sentinels
	 * simplifies the presentation of several of our search and update
	 * algorithms. With care, they can be represented as null references in
	 * practice, thereby reducing the number of nodes in half (since there are
	 * more leaves than internal nodes in a proper binary tree).
