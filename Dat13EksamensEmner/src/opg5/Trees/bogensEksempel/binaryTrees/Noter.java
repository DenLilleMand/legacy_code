	 * A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:
1. Every node has at most two children.
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child.
3. A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.
The subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node v is called a left subtree
or right subtree, respectively, of v. A binary tree is proper if each node has either
zero or two children. Some people also refer to such trees as being full binary
trees. Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children.
A binary tree that is not proper is improper.
