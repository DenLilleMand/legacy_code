 * Edges and Paths in Trees
An edge of tree T is a pair of nodes (u,v) such that u is the parent of v, or vice
versa. A path of T is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in
the sequence form an edge. For example, the tree in Figure 8.3 contains the path
(cs252/, projects/, demos/, market).


Ordered Trees
A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each
node; that is, we purposefully identify the children of a node as being the first,
second, third, and so on. Such an order is usually visualized by arranging siblings
left to right, according to their order.
