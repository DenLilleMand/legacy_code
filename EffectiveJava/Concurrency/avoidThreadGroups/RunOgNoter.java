	 * Avoid thread groups
	 * tl;dr;
	 * 'To summarize: Thread groups don't provide much i nthe way of useful
	 *  functionality, and much of the functionality they do provide is flawed. Thread groups 
	 *  are best viewed as an unsuccessful experiment, and you should simply ignore their existence. If 
	 *  your design a class that deals with logical groups of threads, you should probably use thread pool executors.'
	 * 
	 * HUSK at thread groups er ikke  det samme som Thread pools.
