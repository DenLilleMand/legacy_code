	 * Et eksempel på hvorfor man overholder interfaces osv:
	 * In order to formalize our abstraction of a stack, we define what is known as its
application programming interface (API) in the form of a Java interface, which
describes the names of the methods that the ADT supports and how they are to be
declared and used. This interface is defined in Code Fragment 6.1.

Det er så taget fra starten af et Stack kapitel om dets interface.
